I am confused by browser version detection. What I need is blocking the browsers which are ie6/ie7/ff3 , however, I can't easily detect browser version. Cause I got the version which is like that "6.0.2900.5512.xpsp_sp3_gdr.100427-1636".
so I write an easy plugin to check the browser version and you can also use callback to block these kind of old fashion browser or do anything else.
 
 For example:
 $.detectBrowserVersion({
     filter: {
         webkit: '535'
     },
     callback: function(){
         alert('do you live in stone age?');
     }
 });
